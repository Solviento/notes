- 4 Key components to any Kanban Board
  - To Do
    - Tasks due to be done
  - In Progress
    - Tasks currently being worked upon
  - Done
    - Tasks which have been completed
  - Limited WIP (Work In Progress)

- Product Owner
  - Responsible for the feature list contained within the backlog
  - Ultimate say on whether a product meets the requirements or not
- Team
  - Responsible for delivering the product
  - Responsible for organizing the work done and how it is done
  - Regularly reflect in order to improve the teamâ€™s performance and ability
- Scrum Master
  - Responsible for ensuring that Scrum is done
  - Shields the team from unwanted distractions from stakeholders

**Basic Kanban/Scrum Steps**

1. Identify Features (Usually done by the product owner)
2. Break features down into tasks
3. Create as many tasks as can be done in the time limit (1 sprint)
4. Team members select own tasks to work on

**Continuous Integration**

- How do you ensure that your projects are working when working by yourself?

- How might you ensure that the software works when working in a team?
  - Continuous Integration
    - Works with sourse control to provide up to date detail on whether the central build is broken or not
    - Automates running of Unit Tests whenever a commit occurs
    - Enables the team to verify integrity of the build without dedicating a person to constantly checking
    - CI should be used as part of your Solo Project
    - It should be the first thing to set up
