/*Given a character array s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The words in s will be separated by a single space.
Your code must solve the problem in-place, i.e. without allocating extra space.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["a"]
Output: ["a"]
