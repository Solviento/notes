HTML

Stands for Hyper Text Markup Language

Building blocks of HTML pages

<!DOCTYPE html>

HTML images

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag

<img src="apple.png" alt="apple.com" width="200" height="140">

The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used in the case where an image cannot be displayed

The style attribute is used to specify the styling of an element, like font, color or size

<p style="color:red">I am a paragraph</p>

HTML fonts

The font-family property  defines the font to be used for an HTML element

Font size, text alignment, color can also be used on text



HTML formatting

<b>, <em>, <small>, <sup>, <sub>

Use q for short quotations

Blockquotes can also be used

<blockquote cite="worldwildlife.com/index.html" For 50 years, protection of nature".</blockquote>

Use abbr for an abbreviation or acronym

<abbr title="World Health Org"</abbr>



Single vs double quotes

In some situations it is necessary to alternate between single and double quotes

<p title="Bill 'Willy' Numel"



Separate content

Background color, text color, border color, and more can be used to colorize HTML elements



HTML block and inline elements

A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can)

The <div> element is a block level element.

Includes <address>, <figure>, <form>, etc

An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary

<span>, <a>, <b>, <label>, <img>, etc
