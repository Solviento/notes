**The Game of Life or Death**

An ongoing theory of how the world functions.

Consider this scenario.

Take any living being on Earth. Let's say for example Ariel, a barista from Starbucks located somewhere along the coast. Ariel is a young, hardworking, and optimistic college student who enjoys a vast range of recreational activities. Since childhood, Ariel was taught by her parents to take caution against risky ventures as most attentive parents ought to do.

But risk is its own reward.

See now here's the thing. Why would Ariel want to strive to become a young, hardworking, and optimistic college student who works at Starbucks?

As the day ends Ariel leaves her place of work, takes the train back home, and arrives at the corner of her apartment complex. In the corner of her eye, a small group of young men are entertaining themselves in front of a grocery store [or bodega in the Bronx].
