**Biometric Types**

- Physiological characteristics/identifiers
  - Facial recognition
  - Fingerprints
  - Finger geometry (size and position of fingers)
  - Iris recognition
  - Vein recognition
  - Retina scanning
  - Voice recognition
  - DNA matching
- Behavioral identifiers
  - How individuals act, recognition of typing patterns, walking gait, gestures
  - Can provide continuous authentication instead of a single one-off authentication check

**Biometric Advantages**

- Hard to fake or steal, unlike passwords.
- Ease of use and convenience.
- Change little over a userâ€™s life.
- Are non-transferrable.
- Templates take up less storage.

**Biometric Disadvantages**

- It is costly to get a biometric system up and running.
- If the system fails to capture all of the biometric data, it can lead to failure in identifying a user.
- Databases holding biometric data can still be hacked.
- Errors such as false rejects and false accepts can still happen.
- If a user gets injured, then a biometric authentication system may not work (for example user burns their hand, then a fingerprint scanner may not be able to identify them).
