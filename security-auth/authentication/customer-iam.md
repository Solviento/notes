**Customer Identity and Access Management (Customer IAM)**

### **The core of CIAM – identity**

- As the name implies, Customer IAM (CIAM) is all about your customers. It’s about creating a seamless, secure experience across digital services and devices, by putting the customer’s identity at the beginning of their journey with you. 
- So, it’s no surprise that at the very core of Customer IAM are the customer identities; how to capture and manage them; and controlling their access to your applications and services. 
- CIAM is about knowing who your customer is and making their lives as easy and convenient as possible, without sacrificing security, when they move through your services.

### CIAM – is it Consumer or Customer IAM?

- The biggest differences between Customer and Consumer IAM are in the use cases and whether the focus is on B2B or B2C. 
- Do you have consumers or customers or both? Consumer IAM is a subcategory of Customer IAM, serving B2C only. 
  - Customer IAM serves both B2B and B2C cases, and that’s why Ubisecure tends to use *Customer* IAM – because it covers them both.

### **Single identity**

- At the core of Customer IAM is understanding your customers behaviour and how to manage your customer/consumer identities. 
- **CIAM is about enabling an effortless user journey, without sacrificing security and data protection.** How can this be done? 
  - By single identity and Single-Sign-On (SSO). Single-Sign-On is the idea of allowing your customer to use a single identity, or already-existing identity, to access your services. 
  - One password; one set of user credentials. You can even let your customers access your partner businesses services with the same identity, without any extra logins. 
  - Or let them use social identities to make the authentication process even simpler. The idea of single identity takes the pressure of re-authenticating and remembering a bucket-load of account credentials away, and makes the user experience simple and easy. 
  - Not to mention the cost savings for businesses in password and identity management, centralised policy control and improved risk mitigation.

### **Step up to the next level of digital transformation**

- Customer IAM enables self-service user management. You can enable your customers, external contractors and partners to manage their own identities, identity attributes, and to assign roles to those identities. 
- This will remove your user management admin, improve customer satisfaction, ensure better compliance (think GDPR), improve loyalty and trust due to transparency, reduce costs and improve security – to name just some of the benefits!

- The trick is to allow your customer organisation to take control of the identities you have for them. Your customer can invite people into the site, activate new services through self-service functions, authorise their own users properly, or even authorise people from other organisations to represent them in the service. 
- This can be site specific or on a project-by-project basis. Your customers, partners and stakeholders will also maintain accurate information about their identity attributes by themselves, taking a yet another layer of identity management off your desk. Empower your customers via digital transformation.
