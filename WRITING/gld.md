**The Game of Life or Death**

An ongoing theory of how the world functions.

Consider this scenario.

Take any living being on Earth. Let's say for example Ariel, a barista from Starbucks located somewhere along the coast. Ariel is a young, hardworking, and optimistic college student who enjoys a vast range of recreational activities. Since childhood, Ariel was taught by her parents to take caution against risky ventures as most attentive parents ought to do.

But risk is its own reward.

See now here's the thing. Why would Ariel want to strive to become a young, hardworking, and optimistic college student who works at Starbucks?

As the day ends Ariel leaves her place of work, takes the train back home, and arrives at the corner of her apartment complex. In the corner of her eye, a small group of young men are entertaining themselves in front of a grocery store [or bodega in the Bronx].

**Joker Theory**

Routine life is boring. To truly make the most of life, one must sacrifice sanity and achieve the impossible.  Maintaining balance between insanity and compliant sanity.

Life is meaningless in certain context. Once sanity is lost, anything can be given pure meaning through laughter.

To counter the madness. You must embrace the void. Serve as a counter to the dark and the light.

Balance is key. All must be challenged and destroyed to be rebuilt better and stronger.

Constantly strip away yourself to achieve better self?

**The New World Order**

The same story as always, rich + elite classes will fall due to capitalist limitations, economic stagnation and mass discontent. But what will replace the old elites and modern day capitalism?

Neo-socialism (Placeholder until something better comes up)

Revolution against the elite class. Public-owned entities to take up the mantle of robotic advancement and control the next stage of human progress. 

Elite classes owning robotic resources will lead to complete social dystopia. Need for masses to collectively own the machines and production under a neo-socialist entity. 

Why did communist revolution fail to bring about public ownership of tech utilities? 

Probably greed. Need counter to greed for neo-socialism to work.

Could possibly use android companions to fill void of human loneliness.

Sustainable energy + robotic workers = liberation of human toil.

But people need to fill the void of productivity. 

Answers? Space exploration, virtual reality, ...?

The nuclear option is complete re-do. To reset everything and let humanity start from little.
