City of Light

On the outskirts of the Amazon a young woman trekked hurriedly as she made her way past the jungle growth. She looked onward to the west where the mountains resided, "Los Andes" as her tribal elders called it. The wet, soggy flora of the jungle floor kept her from walking faster as she kept her exasperated breathing to a minimum. 

"sun-god-name protect me".

"moon-god-name guide me".

"earth-god-name save me".

Thirty minutes later, she finally saw it. Past the massive trees, the faint glow of a small outpost could be seen flickering in the darkness. The woman's eyes lit up for only a second as she knew that her journey was far from over. With a few deep breaths she quickened her pace and went past the jungle lines to make the last quarter mile to her destination.

At the moment she found herself within walking distance of the outpost, two shadowy figures appeared from the main cabin.

"Stop! Reveal yourself!".

"Alera, my name is Alera! I seek asylum with the Kingdom of Altos, please I come in peace!".

"Alera? By the gods, the rumors are true. But how?".

"It doesn't matter how, she came all the way here from Ordos. Come here, quickly".

"Hold on Kiala, her tracks are visible. Any fool with an eye could have tracked her here. It's not safe to bring her".

"This may be a risk but our orders were to bring her past the jagged point for questioning. We'll work with what we have."

"Bless the nine and bless your kind souls, I don't mean you harm".

"No you don't but Zarama does and when that woman wants someone dead, she'll murder an entire village to do so."

"Quiet. This poor girl needs our help, look at her for sky-god-name sake".

"If she came here on foot then any royalist agents going after her should be closing in. Come inside now and tell us everything."

"Through here." Kiala motioned her arm to the wooden entrance of the cabin.

"If I had known we'd have company I'd have cleaned the ashes out from floor."

"No you wouldn't. You never do. I have yet to see you try on a day outside of Lakma."

"And I have yet to see you try to refuse strangers that could very well murder us in our sleep."

"Look at her, she's unarmed and exhausted. She's not a threat to anyone."

"You don't need to be armed to be a threat. I still have the bruise marks to show for it."

"Next time go left when I go right. This way I won't hit that pretty face of yours."

"Oh dah dah dah. You are so funny."
