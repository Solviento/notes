# Ch.8 Recursion and Dynamic Programming

Patterns
- Recursive problems may start with: design an algorithm to compute the nth, write code to list the first n, implement a method to compute all ..

Approach to Recursion
- Recursive solutions are built off of solutions to subproblems
- Bottom up approach
  - Most intuitive
  - We can build the solution for one case off of the previous case 

Top Down Approach
  - More complex since its less concrete
  - We think about how we can divide the problem for case N into subproblems
  - Be careful of overlap

Half and Half Approach
- Can be effective to divide the data set in half
- Binary search works with half and half approach 
- Merge sort is also half and half approach, "divide and conquer"
